bi notes: 

Omited a few commits to keep Google-mobile-ads-sdk at version 10.9.
(This is to match the version of our firebase matching dependencies)
Current firebase sdk: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/releases/tag/10.14.0

Commits skiped:

In order to use the latest commit instead, would need to use this versio of firebase:
https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/releases/tag/10.25.0

It would match with Google-Mobile-Ads-SDK 11.3 which is the same version as the tip of poing

     alt="Preview" width="auto" height="390">


This repository is for a _Godot Engine Plugin_ that allows showing the ads offered by **AdMob** in an **easy** way, without worrying about the building or version, **just download and use**.

The **purpose** of this plugin is to always keep **up to date with Godot**, supporting **ALMOST ALL** versions from v4.1+, and also make the code **compatible** on **[Android](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-android) and iOS**, so each advertisement will work **identically on both systems**.

### üîë Key features

- It's a wrapper for [Google Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/download). üéÅ
- Easy Configuration. üòÄ
- Supports nearly all Ad Formats: **Banner**, **Interstitial**, **Rewarded**, **Rewarded Interstitial**. üì∫
- GDPR Compliance with UMP Support. ‚úâÔ∏è
- Targeting Capabilities. üéØ
- Seamless integration with Mediation partners: **AdColony**, **Meta**, **Vungle**. üí∞
- CI/CD for streamlined development and deployment. üîÑüöÄ
- Features a dedicated [Godot Plugin](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-plugin), reducing the need for extensive coding. üîå
- There is also an [Android Plugin](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-android) available, which has the same behavior. ü§ñ

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to use 
- We recommend you to use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-plugin), you can download direcly from [Godot Assets](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2063).
- After download, we recommend you to read the [README.md](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-plugin/blob/master/README.md) of the Plugin to know how to use.

## üì¶Installing:

### üì•Download
- To get started, download the `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-ios/releases). We recommend checking the [supported Godot version](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-versions/blob/master/versions.json) before proceeding. You can also use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-plugin) for this step by navigating to `Tools -> AdMob Download Manager -> iOS -> LatestVersion`.


### üßë‚ÄçüíªUsage
- Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/WpVGn7ZasKM.
- Inside `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` you downloaded, you will face some folders like `'ads'`, `'adcolony'`, `'meta'`, `'vungle'`. To AdMob works only `'ads'` is required, but if you want [Mediation](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/13420272?hl=en), you need the other folders.
- Move the content inside the folder which you need into ```res://ios/plugins``` directory on your Godot project.
- Update the configuration in ```res://ios/plugins/poing-godot-admob-ads.gdip```. The `GADApplicationIdentifier` is required to change when release your game.
- If you are using Mediation: On `SKAdNetworkItems` in `.gdip` file, you can remove the comments of the [Mediations Networks](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/choose-networks) which you are using.
- Export the project enabling the `Ad Mob`, if you have Mediation, also mark `Ad Mob Meta`, `Ad Mob AdColony` etc...

### üíªXcode preparation
- Go to `{{ ios_xcode_export_folder }}/{{your_project_name}}/ios/plugins/poing-godot-admob/scripts/` folder and open the terminal (must be inside this folder).
- Run the commands: 
```bash
chmod +x update_and_install.sh
./update_and_install.sh
```
- This will create for your a `{{ your_project_name }}.xcworkspace` file on your `{{ ios_xcode_export_folder }}`, open this file.
- Go to the Target of your Application and them `General -> Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` and add all `Pods` in section.
- Run the Game.
- [If you are trying to run on Simulator and is not working read this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/44681#issuecomment-751399783).
